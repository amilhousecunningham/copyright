    <!--QUESTION #1 -->
    <h3>Question # 1 - What is Copyright?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> The U.S. Copyright Office defines copyright as a
      "type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship
      as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression"
      (U.S. Copyright Office). Copyright law protects original and fixed works.
      Original works are "independently created by a human author and have a
      minimal degree of creativity" (U.S. Copyright Office). However, fixed
      works are "captured (either by or under the authority of an author) in a
      sufficiently permanent medium such that the work can be perceived,
      reproduced, or communicated for more than a short time" (U.S. Copyright
      Office). Click the link below for more details.

    <!--QUESTION #2 -->
    <h3>Question # 2 - What is Fair Use?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> The Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center
      defines fair use as "any copying of copyrighted material done for a
      limited and “transformative” purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize,
      or parody a copyrighted work" (Stim, 2021). In these cases, permission
      from the copyright owner is not required. Click the links below for more
      details.
